## Implementation of (TF-IDF, cosine) + BM25 +HITS algorithm

Understand the vector space model (TF-IDF, cosine) + BM25 works in searching. Explore real-world challenges of building a graph (in this case, from Epinions), implement and test the classic HITS algorithm over this graph. Experiment with real-world search engine optimization techniques.
